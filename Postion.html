        Milestone 1: Define Problem / Problem Understanding
        ● Activity 1: Specify the business problem
        Refer Project Description
        ● Activity 2: Business requirements
        The business requirements for a project aimed at "Identifying Patterns and
        Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning" would likely
        include the following:
        ❖ Access to campus placement data: The project would require
        access to data on student performance, qualifications, and job
        placement outcomes. This data would need to be collected,
        cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
        ❖ Machine learning expertise: The project would require
        individuals with expertise in machine learning, data science and
        statistical analysis to develop and implement the algorithms and
        models needed to analyze the data.
        ❖ Data storage and management: The project would require a
        robust and secure data storage and management system to store
        and organize the large amounts of data used in the analysis.
        ❖ Infrastructure for model deployment: The project would require
        infrastructure for deploying the models and algorithms
        developed, including hardware, software, and cloud-based
        resources.
        ● Activity 3: Literature Survey (Student Will Write)
        ❖ There have been several studies that have used machine learning
        techniques to identify patterns and trends in campus placement
        data.
        ❖ One study by authors P. K. Rajesh and Dr. G. R. Suresh,
        published in the International Journal of Computer Science and
        Mobile Computing in 2015, used k-means clustering and decision
        trees to analyze campus placement data and identify patterns that
        could be used to predict placement outcomes.
        ❖ Another study by authors V.V. Kulkarni and K.S. Patil, published
        in the International Journal of Engineering Research and
        Technology in 2012, used decision tree and neural network
        algorithms to analyze campus placement data and identify factors
        that influence student placement.
        ❖ A study by authors S.S. Bhosale, S.S. Raut, and D.S. Kulkarni,
        published in the International Journal of Emerging Research in
        Management & Technology in 2013, used decision tree and
        Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze campus placement data and
        predict student placement outcomes.
        ❖ A study by authors S.S. Bhosale, S.S. Raut, and D.S. Kulkarni,
        published in the International Journal of Emerging Research in

        Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze campus placement data and
        predict student placement outcomes.
        ❖ In general, these studies found that machine learning techniques
        were effective at identifying patterns and trends in campus
        placement data, and could be used to predict student placement
        outcomes with high accuracy.
        ❖ It's important to note that all these studies are quite old now and
        you might find more recent studies and new techniques which
        can be useful for your project.
        ● Activity 4: Social or Business Impact.
        ❖ The business impact of a project that uses machine learning to
        identify patterns and trends in campus placement data could be
        significant. By analyzing data on factors such as student
        performance, qualifications, and job placement outcomes, the
        project could help organizations make more informed decisions
        about recruiting and hiring new graduates.
        Milestone 2: Data Collection & Preparation
        ML depends heavily on data. It is the most crucial aspect that makes
        algorithm training possible. So this section allows you to download the
        required dataset.
        ● Activity 1: Collect the dataset
        There are many popular open sources for collecting the data. Eg:
        kaggle.com, UCI repository, etc. In this project we have used .csv data.
        This data is downloaded from kaggle.com. Please refer to the link
        given below to download the dataset.

                        resources.
                        ● Activity 3: Literature Survey (Student Will Write)
                        ❖ There have been several studies that have used machine learning
                        techniques to identify patterns and trends in campus placement
                        data.
                        ❖ One study by authors P. K. Rajesh and Dr. G. R. Suresh,
                        published in the International Journal of Computer Science and
                        Mobile Computing in 2015, used k-means clustering and decision
                        trees to analyze campus placement data and identify patterns that
                        could be used to predict placement outcomes.
                        ❖ Another study by authors V.V. Kulkarni and K.S. Patil, published
                        in the International Journal of Engineering Research and
                        Technology in 2012, used decision tree and neural network
                        algorithms to analyze campus placement data and identify factors
                        that influence student placement.
                        ❖ A study by authors S.S. Bhosale, S.S. Raut, and D.S. Kulkarni,
                        published in the International Journal of Emerging Research in
                        Management & Technology in 2013, used decision tree and
                        Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze campus placement data and
                        predict student placement outcomes.
                        ❖ A study by authors S.S. Bhosale, S.S. Raut, and D.S. Kulkarni,
                        published in the International Journal of Emerging Research in
                        Management & Technology in 2013, used decision tree and
                        Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze campus placement data and
                        predict student placement outcomes.
                        ❖ In general, these studies found that machine learning techniques
                        were effective at identifying patterns and trends in campus
                        placement data, and could be used to predict student placement
                        outcomes with high accuracy.
                        ❖ It's important to note that all these studies are quite old now and
                        you might find more recent studies and new techniques which
                        can be useful for your project.
                        ● Activity 4: Social or Business Impact.
                        ❖ The business impact of a project that uses machine learning to
                        identify patterns and trends in campus placement data could be
                        significant. By analyzing data on factors such as student
                        performance, qualifications, and job placement outcomes, the
                        project could help organizations make more informed decisions
                        about recruiting and hiring new graduates.
                        Milestone 2: Data Collection & Preparation
                        ML depends heavily on data. It is the most crucial aspect that makes
                        algorithm training possible. So this section allows you to download the
                        required dataset.
                        ● Activity 1: Collect the dataset
                        There are many popular open sources for collecting the data. Eg:
                        kaggle.com, UCI repository, etc. In this project we have used .csv data.
                        This data is downloaded from kaggle.com. Please refer to the link
                        given below to download the dataset.
